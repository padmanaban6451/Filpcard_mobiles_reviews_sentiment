"Nothing 2a has EXCEEDED my expectations, being a midrange phone it looks, feels and performs as a flagship..it's definately an eye grabber, glyphs are not just for the show but has real life uses.. one drawback though is finger prints are all over the phone, it's too glossy, or may be because I got the black one.. but other than that this phone is lit üî• Good job Nothing.. I'm sure my next phone is gonna be Nothing 3? Hoping for the best",5,Perfect product!,MOBGVMQS98EEEKTZ
"What a stunning product!!! For me the special edition design is the best among all the Nothing 2(a) variants. Design, Camera and Performance deserves 5/5 star reviews. Really worth every penny.

I was looking for a mid range phone with decent specs and clean android experience and this phone delivers. Ordered it on the first hour of sale and have been using it full time once I received it. The only issue that I have been experiencing is with the charging speed as it takes approx 3 hours to fully charge the phone. I have tried both 45 watt nothing charger and cmf by nothing 65 watt charger and used the cable supplied in the box. Hope this is fixed by nothing as soon as possible,4,Value-for-money,MOBGVMQS98EEEKTZ

Good Experience with the software update. In Android never see this type of UI.

In this budget without thinking buy it. In this price you are getting premium segment features. and it's touch feel like premium phone.

It's glyph's light is very entertaining and useful.

Battery back up is very good.

You can customise the apps icon, Widgets.

"I am an iOS user and purchased this as a secondary device, and I must say it's a good machine in the mid-segment. Being an iOS user, I liked the design of this phone; it is something new and refreshing. Also, the user experience of this phone is amazing. Although I've only used it for a couple of hours until now, it's not feasible to check each and every department, but overall, it's a good experience.

"First things first, if you're someone who's looking for a rich experience rather than gaming among others, this is the phone to go. If you're looking for a gaming phone then unfortunately this cannot be recommended nevertheless this does better in gaming but not what other competitors are offering at this price point.

The camera was initially not so great but later after say 2 software updates it got tremendous.
Attached are the images that are taken after the update.

Really impressed with the fluid display, UI and satisfactory battery life. I am not a hardcore gamer but the chipset is on the top of handling everyday tasks butter smooth.

Purchased samsung 25w pd charger that charges my phone in 1.5hrs from 0 to 100. I didn't go for OnePlus Nord CE 4 because of the Color OS (which the...

Camera is awesome. I mean its my first phone with OIS

Good for multitasking. Looks and glyph interface is also awesome.

Haven't done any game trials yet. Honestly i dont play games in new phone. It ruins the battery.

Switching between apps and opening new apps works amazingly fast. 12gb ram has its perks. Didn't feel the need to use the ram extender feature.
