Display- One of the best display not only in the price range but it can compete with the high end phone also. 5/5.

I'm using this mobile from last 20 days only one complain is hear that's battery drain fast and heating issue otherwise this mobile is beast under 25k please solve this problem with software updates,4,Fair,MOBGWMGBEVDXXEZC
The battery drains very fastly like a rocket. Only 10X zoom from the camera side. Highly contrast colors from the main camera side. Heating issues. Performance wise in the high end side. The display is also very good.,3,Just okay,MOBGWMGBEVDXXEZC
Best All rounder at this price range. Dimensity 8300 ultra is equal to 8 gen 2. Under 25k best option. Don't think go for it if you want to experience fast and long run device..,5,Great product,MOBGWMGBEVDXXEZC

Hyper OS is glitch free and smooth. Didn't see any hung or crash issues so far in 1 week.
