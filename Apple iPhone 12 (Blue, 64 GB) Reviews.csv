"I always bought a android flagship device but i was very dissapointed because they all lag or record low fps video in third party apps that's is why switched to IOS now i m happy with the performance and also it's not bulky because it's a 6.1 inch display phone which is very easy to carry
Big thumbs up for thatüëçüëçüëç",4,Value-for-money,MOBFWBYZ8DNJNY7N
"This is my first iPhone after being an android guy for last 10yr. Main reason for the switch was, having an Macbook and airpod already. So wanted to experience synergy between apple products in its ecosystem. Here is my 2 week review
Pros
1. Screen Quality is great. My last phone was Oneplus 7, so jump in screen quality was noticeable
2. Performance. This phone with iOS feels extremely fluid. The old phone feels not so snappy compared to it. Also, since i have never used a 90Hz display so di...

"I have been using iPhone 12 from past 10 days. Overall a great phone with best battery life, best camera and great display. The most important thing about this phone is the performance. It‚Äôs top notch. A14 Bionic chip which is 5mm SOC with 5G modem delivers a greater performance without any lag. With few latest iOS updates(14.7.1) and few changes in configuration/settings I get a battery life for 2 days per charge(96%). Overall a beast in all segments including the price.",5,Awesome,MOBFWBYZ8DNJNY7N
"I bought this iPhone after plenty of research and it‚Äôs The best value for money iPhone with all mandatory features like IP68 rating , OLED Display , 5G with all 12 bands , 5 nm Architecture A14 Bionic Chip , Dark Mode with Dolby Vision , Wi-Fi 6 & NFC , Stereo Speakers , MagSafe compatibility . So turning out to be a complete iPhone experience , truly loving it.",5,Great product,MOBFWBYZ8DNJNY7N

"Just bought my first iPhone. Been using it for like 15 days now. This is litttüî•.
Was worried about battery performance before buying. But it far exceeded the expectations. Can last even 2 days if you use judiciously with low power mode.

"I was using realme x7 max before purchasing iPhone 12 but honestly I want to tell one thing that iPhones are overhyped and nothing
I don‚Äôt feel any upgradation from my previous phone but compromised from many aspects.
