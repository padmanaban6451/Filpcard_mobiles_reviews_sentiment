"I have been using the Pixel 8 for 2 months. Here is my experience so far. I'll divide the review in Pros and cons.
Pro:
1. Camera: So far this is the proper point and shoot camera. Just open the camera, click pictures and they will turn out to be great. Compared to Samsung's, iphone people prefer pictures by pixel, be it any situation.
2. UI: There's a following for pixel users that blindly opt for it. I'll have to say they are right about it. It was a great experience using it any day. If yo...

"Whoever is thinking bout buying the phone right now stop. If you ain't getting any good offers or you are not a pixel fan, then there is no point in buying this phone at this price.
Pros:-

Cameras: like every other youtuber is saying bout this phones cameras, it's top class. The raw photos has really good details and the dynamic range is pretty good. I would say photos are better than the iphones. Videos with this phone can easily be compared with the videos from iphone 13/14/15. Also you wi...

I bought p8 for 54k with cc and exchange and other offer.so far I am highly satisfied. Display is great but less contrasty so you feel washed out colour after switching from old phone. I am getting 6 to 7 hrs of SOT with a new software update. The phone will be warm some time on the network but not on wifi. I haven't noticed any call drops. I think the recent software update resolved many issues. Go for it if you are not a gamer.,5,Highly recommended,MOBGW6NGMC7FNGMC

"Initial impressions (its been about three days since I got the phone)
The phone looks and feels GREAT. Better in real life than in pictures (even the official pictures put up by Google). Definitely an eye-turner in a market full of samsungs and apples.
The camera lives up to the hype. Realistic images - what you see with your eyes is what the phone captures.

"What you'll like:
- Great pics.. no matter what the lighting. Came here from an S22 Ultra. Unlike that, the P8 naturally knows when and how to take the perfect, contrasty pic. IDK how!!

There's no way I'm going back to a mid range or cheap phone like the Oppos or Redmi again. Not like I'll have to ever, the longevity of Google is enough to keep me with them for many years.

It's too early for review but this is based on first few days experience. 7 years of OS and security updates was pleasant and unexpected. I was a fan since Nexus series but now with the Pixel series specifically Pixel 8 they did a major upgrade complementing with AI and photography.
